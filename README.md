# UsefulCalc
ðŸ“° Calculator with some useful school math expression that me myself would trade lot's of cookies for that functionality back in highschool.

Alongside all natural benefits of being a calculator this app offers 10 extra buttons that adds some neat expressions. 

## Functionality
- Logarithm 
  - 2l8 = 3
- Factor 
  - x^2 + 2x = x(x + 2)
- Derive
  - x^2 + 2x = 2x + 2
- Integrate
  - x^2 + 2x = 1/3x^3 + x^2 + C
- Find 0's
  - x^2 + 2x = [-2, 0]
- Find Tangent
  - 2lx^3 = 12x - 16
- Area Under Curve
  - 2:4lx^3 = 60
- Simplifying Expressions
  - 9x * 4 + 3 = 36x + 3
- Standard Calculating
  - 3.5 * 2 / 3 = 2.3333
- Expanding Previous Equation
  - 2.5 * 3 = 7.5
  - \+ 2 = 10
  - \* 1/2 = 9 
    - gives: 2.5 * 3 + 2 * 1/2 = 9
    - (because adding [times 1/2] after a [plus 2] takes priority and gives [1]
